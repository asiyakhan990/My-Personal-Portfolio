        Hi, I'm Asiya Khan. An Aspiring Web Developer and AI Enthusiast with a
        strong passion for building innovative and scalable web applications.
        Currently expanding my skills in modern web technologies such as HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript and back-end development,
        while also exploring the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence.
        Eager to combine my growing expertise in coding with AI concepts like
        machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing. A
        quick learner with a collaborative mindset, I'm committed to
        continuously developing my technical abilities and applying them to
        create impactful, user-centric solutions. Looking for opportunities to
        grow and contribute to projects that merge web development with
        AI-driven innovation. In web development, I am learning the ins and outs
        of both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js. I am particularly
        fascinated by building interactive and responsive websites that provide
        seamless user experiences across all devices. On the AI side, I am
        diving into the world of machine learning, deep learning, and data
        analysis. Whether it's building intelligent systems, working with neural
        networks, or exploring natural language processing, I am excited about
        the impact AI can have on industries like healthcare, finance, and
        entertainment. Ultimately, I strive to combine my skills in web
        development and AI to create smarter, more efficient applications that
        can solve real-world problems and improve lives.
